7. What are the issues with JavaScript and JQuery? Why they are not good for SPA and Progressive Apps?
 - JavaScript and JQuery uses lot of DOM manipulations.	
 - Lot of references
 - Lot of coding 
 - Navigation Issues
   [history object - back, forward, go()]
   [location object - reload]
 - DataBinding
   [How data is accessed and binded to UI]
   [lot of references and events are required]
 - Heavy Application
 - JavaScript is a language and JQuery is a Libary And a library or language can't control the application flow. They are just responsible for building application but not controlling the flow of application.
   [Application can't control its own flow, it depends on lot of events].
	
What is Solution?
- Better use a Framework 
- Framework comprises of language and library which allows to build application and also to control the application flow.
